		<h2>Cooking Tools</h2>
		<div>
		When cooking, a few basic tools and items are necessary. Most are standard and can be found in any kitchen:
		
			<p><a href="knives.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picr" a href="knives.jpg" src="knives.jpg" alt="Knives" height="133" width="200"></a>
				<b>Knives</b> are necessary to chop and prepare ingredients. Some prefer using different knives to cut and chop different
				things: a sharper knife may be better for cutting and cleaning meat, where a heavier cutting knife might make the task of
				chopping denser, thicker foods (eg root vegetables) a little easier. Some prefer and are accustomed to using a heavier 
				cleaver to chop things, but not necessary if you do not have one. Comfort and ease of use, along with a sharp blade are
				important qualities to consider.
			</p>
			
			<p><a href="cuttingboards.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picl" src="cuttingboards.jpg" alt="Cutting boards" height="133" width="200"></a>
				<b>Cutting boards</b> are necessary for providing a surface to chop things up. Much like using different knives, some prefer to
				designate certain cutting boards when cutting certain foods: using a separate cutting board for raw meat and another for
				cooked food or raw vegetables can help avoid cross-contamination. The material of the cutting board should also be considered
				when being used: plastic boards are easier to sanitize<sup>1</sup> than wooden boards, but easier to cut grooves into, where
				bacteria can settle. The same can be said for wooden boards made of softer woods.
			</p>
			
			<p><a href="measuringtools.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picr" src="measuringtools.jpg" alt="Measuring cups and spoons" height="133" width="200"></a>
				Standard <b>measuring cups</b> and <b>measuring spoons</b> to portion out the right amount of ingredients. 
			</p>
			
			<p id="clear"><a href="bowls.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picl" src="bowls.jpg" alt="Bowls" height="133" width="200"></a>
				<b>Bowls</b> to hold the prepared ingredients, especially if the recipe calls for several to many different ingredients.
				Some ingredients will react differently to different materials, for example, using non-reactive material, such as 
				ceramic or stainless steel, is ideal for certain acidic ingredients.
			</p>
			
			<p id="clear"><a href="potspans.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picr" src="potspans.jpg" alt="Pots and pans" height="133" width="200"></a>
				A <b>pot</b> or a <b>pan</b> in which to heat and cook the ingredients, as well as boil or steam. In regards to 
				pan or stir-frying, whether one is non-stick or not isn't a large concern, some cooking oil can be added to prevent 
				sticking. Some prefer using a traditional wok for authenticity and its efficiency of cooking food at a high temperature 
				in a shorter amount of time. For home cooking, from experience, I have found that standard cookware can suffice in 
				capturing the desired flavour of Chinese cuisine. 
			</p>
			
			<p><a href="stirringtools.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picl" src="stirringtools.jpg" alt="Spatula, tongs, chopsticks" height="133" width="200"></a>
				A <b>spatula</b>, <b>wooden spoon</b>, <b>chopsticks</b>, <b>tongs</b> or any other utensil to stir and handle 
				food while cooking in the pot or pan. Depending on the recipe and ingredients that are being cooked, some
				utensils may be better suited for certain foods and recipes than others, depending on cooking temperature,
				fragility of ingredients and other factors.
			</p>
			
			<p><a href="othertools.jpg" width="550" height"425"><img id="picr" src="othertools.jpg" alt="Steamer, strainer, other utensils" height="133" width="200"></a>
				Other utensils and tools for specific use&mdash; <b>rolling pins</b>, to flatten dough meant for crusts and wrappers;
				<b>strainers</b>, for rinsing ingredients, as well as for sifting and straining ingredients into a finer consistency;
				<b>graters</b>, when a recipe calls for an ingredient to be shredded, grated or minced; <b>citrus reamer</b>, when the 
				recipes requires citrus juice; <b>meat tenderizer</b>, to soften and tenderize meat, for better flavour absorption and
				cooking consistency; <b>steamer</b>, an alternative method of cooking, where food is placed in a ventilated
				rack atop boiling water and the heat from the steam cooks the food.

			<h3>Missing Something?</h3>	
			<p>
			If you find yourself short of some utensils and cooking tools, a few places to consider looking:
			<dl>
				<dt><b>Dollar Store</b></dt>
					<dd>There is often a selection of decent quality (sometimes brand-name)cookware, at a cheaper price.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>Asian Grocery Stores</b></dt>	
					<dd>As more Asian grocery stores are accessible, depending on your location, when it comes to specific
						utensils or tools. Most grocery stores will carry a selection of basic cooking implements, although 
						the variety	will depend from store to store.</dd>
				<br>
				<dt><b>"Off-price" Retailers</b></dt>
					<dd>Eg Winners, TJ Max, etc. Compared to Wal-Mart or Amazon,
						 you can sometimes find decent prices for brand-name, quality made items. There's often also a good variety of
						utensils available, but be wary, as with everything else in the store, stock is not consistent.</dd>
