	Another site about Chinese cooking! What makes this one so different? This site is meant to be a starting point for anyone interested in cooking Chinese
	cuisine or cooking in general. Chinese cuisine is a large part of the Chinese culture, bringing family and friends together for any occasion, with many 
	techniques and recipes passed down from old tradition. The food is downright delicious and can be quite simple to prepare and learn.
	</p>

	<p>
	As stated in the site’s name, making a Chinese dish can be done in any kitchen. Cooking is a useful, invaluable life skill to have. Much of it is preparation, 
	along with assembly and execution. There may be techniques and certain ways of preparing ingredients and dishes that through practice will become simple and 
	standard. Dishes that may seem complicated at first, you’ll discover, are just recipes with additional steps and an extra layer or two of preparation. 
	</p>

	<p>
	The recipes on this site are meant to walk you through each step of preparation and cooking, with details and pictures to inform and help you. With time, 
	the hope is that you’ll be able to cook, enjoy and master these dishes, and discover others as well!

	After a bit of browsing through the site, I’m sure you’ll notice a few things missing. <b><i>Do note that this site is still under construction and will be 
	frequently updated</i></b>.

	A little about myself: I have been cooking for about 20 years now, but more importantly, am the child of two people who can cook amazing food. My Cantonese
	father grew up working in restaurants and did so throughout his academic career to pay for his schooling to become a teacher. He eventually taught Chinese 
	cooking at adult education in the evening (while teaching at elementary school during the day). My mother is from a family of six children from Taiwan and 
	picked up her cooking skills as she grew up. As a child, I was spoiled: my mom made everything from sticky rice (zhong) to dumplings to breads and pastries, 
	my father also carried his share of cooking for the family, not just Chinese but he enjoyed Western and international recipes as well. When I was first on 
	my own and cooked more often, I’d call them many times about the recipes they made, as I’m sure is the experience of numerous grown children. My lack of 
	experience and its result made me appreciate my parents’ habit and living of cooking and food preparation much more. Since then, I’ve worked at learning
	and recreating favourite dishes I’ve grown up on, along with making and perfecting my own.
